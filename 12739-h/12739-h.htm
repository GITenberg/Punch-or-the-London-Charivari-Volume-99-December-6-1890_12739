    <h2>MODERN TYPES.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Own Type Writer.</i>)</h4>

    <h3>No. XXII.&mdash;THE MANLY MAIDEN.</h3>

    <p>The Manly Maiden may be defined as the feminine exaggeration
    of those rougher qualities which men display in their
    intercourse with one another, or in the pursuit of those sports
    in which courage, strength, and endurance play a part. In a
    fatal moment she conceives the idea that she can earn the proud
    title of "a good fellow" by emulating the fashions and the
    habits of the robuster sex. She perceives that men have a
    liking for men who are strong, bluff, outspoken, and
    contemptuous of peril, and she infers mistakenly, that the same
    tribute of admiration is certain to be paid to a woman who,
    setting the traditions of her sex at defiance, consciously apes
    the manly model without a thought of all that the imitation
    involves. She forgets that as soon as a woman steps down of her
    own free will from the pedestal on which the chivalrous
    admiration of men has placed her, she abandons at once her
    claim to that flattering reticence of speech, and that
    specially attentive courtesy of bearing, which are in men the
    outward and visible signs of the spiritual grace which they
    assume as an attribute of all women. In spite of what the crazy
    theorists of the perfect equality school may say, men still
    continue to expect and to admire in women precisely those
    qualities in which they feel themselves to be chiefly
    deficient. Their reverence and affection are bestowed upon her
    whose voice is ever soft, gentle and low, and whose mild
    influence is shed like a balm upon the labours and troubles of
    life. Of slang, and of slaps upon the back, of strength,
    whether of language or of body, they get enough and to spare
    amongst themselves, and they are scarcely to be blamed if at
    certain moments they should prefer refinement to roughness, and
    gentleness to gentlemen. However, these obvious considerations
    have no weight with the Manly Maiden. In fact they never occur
    to her, and hence arise failures, and humiliations, and
    disappointments not a few.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:25%;">
        <a href="images/265.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/265.png"
             alt="The Manly Maiden." /></a>
    </div>

    <p>The Manly Maiden is not, as a rule, the natural product of a
    genuine country life. The daughter of rich parents, who have
    spent a great part of their lives in a centre of commercial
    activity, she is introduced to a new home in the country at
    about the age of fourteen. Seeing that all those who live in
    the neighbourhood are in one way or another associated with
    outdoor sports, and that the favour in which the men are held
    and their fame vary directly as their power to ride or to shoot
    straight, she becomes possessed by the notion that she too
    must, if she is to please at all, be proficient in the sports
    of men. Merely to ride to hounds is, of course, not
    sufficiently distinctive. Many women do that, without losing at
    all the ordinary characteristics of women. She must ride
    bare-backed, she must understand a horse's ailments and his
    points, she must trudge (in the constant society of men) over
    fallows and through turnips in pursuit of partridges, she must
    be able to talk learnedly of guns, of powders, and of shot, she
    must possess a gun of her own, and think she knows how to use
    it, she must own a retriever, and herself make him submissive
    by the frequent application of a silver-headed dog-whip.</p>

    <p>These attainments are her ideals of earthly bliss, and she
    sets out to realise them with a terrible perseverance. Her
    father, of course, knows but little of sport. He is, however,
    afflicted with the ordinary desire to shine as a sportsman, and
    as a host of sportsmen. He stocks his coverts with game, and
    invites large shooting parties to stay with him. He himself
    takes to a gun as a hen might take to the water; although, as
    his daughter contemptuously expresses it, he is calculated to
    miss a hippopotamus at ten yards, he seems to imagine, if one
    may be permitted to judge from the wild frequency of his shots,
    that it is the easiest thing in the world to hit a pheasant or
    a partridge flying at ten times that distance. From such a
    father the Manly Maiden easily secures permission, first of
    all, to walk with the men while they are shooting, and
    subsequently to carry a gun herself.</p>

    <p>And now the difficulties of the situation begin to make
    themselves felt, not, indeed, by her, for she remains sublimely
    unconscious to the end, but by the men who are compelled to
    associate with her upon her ventures. No man will ever hesitate
    to rebuke another for carrying his gun in such a way as to
    threaten danger; but, when a lady allows him to inspect the
    inside of her loaded gun-barrels, or shoots down the line at an
    evasive rabbit, he must suffer in silence, and can only seek
    compensation for restraining his tongue by incontinently
    removing his body to a safe place, where he can neither shoot
    nor be shot. At luncheon, however, he may be gratified by
    hearing the Manly Maiden rally him on the poor result of his
    morning's sport. She will then favour him, at length, with her
    opinions as to how a driven partridge or a rocketing pheasant
    should be shot, flavouring her discourse with copious extracts
    from the Badminton books on shooting, and adding here and there
    imaginative reminiscences of her own exploits in dealing death.
    In the hunting-field she will lose her groom, and babble sport
    to the Master, with whom she further ingratiates herself by
    rating and lashing one of his favourite hounds, or by heading
    the fox whenever he attempts to break away. She then crosses
    him at an awkward fence, and considers herself aggrieved by the
    strong language which breaks irresistibly from the fallen
    sportsman's lips. Later on she astonishes an elderly follower
    of the hounds by asking him for a draught from his flask, and
    completes his amazement by complaining of the thoughtless
    manner in which he has diluted his brandy.</p>

    <p>In the evening she will narrate her adventures at length,
    amidst a chorus of admiring comments from her fond parents, and
    their parasites, and will follow up her triumphs of the day by
    pursuing the men into the smoking-room, where she permits one
    of them to offer her a cigarette, and imagines that she
    delights him by accepting it. On such an occasion she will
    inform one of her friends that, on the whole, she has but a
    poor opinion of Diana of the Ephesians, seeing that she only
    hunted with women, and never allowed men to approach her. From
    this it may be inferred that her stock of classical allusions
    is not quite so accurate and complete as that of a genuine
    sportswoman should be. Next morning she may be seen schooling
    her horses in the park. She has a touching faith in the use
    both of spur and of whip whenever the occasion seems least to
    demand them, and she despises the man who rides without rowels,
    and reverences one who attempts impossible jumps without
    discrimination. During the summer she spends a considerable
    part of her time in "getting fit" for the labours of the autumn
    and winter. Sometimes she even plays cricket, and has been
    known to address the ball that bowled her in highly
    uncomplimentary terms.</p>

    <p>So the years pass on. She never learns that it is possible
    for a woman on certain occasions to be in the way of men, nor
    does her accuracy or her care with a gun increase. If she
    marries at all, she will marry some feeble creature who has no
    feeling for sport, and over whom she can lord it to her heart's
    content. But it is more probable that she will remain unwedded,
    and will develop eventually from a would-be harding-riding
    maiden, into a genuinely hard-featured old maid.</p>

    <h2>A MUSICAL POLE STAR.</h2>

    <p>The Irish Polar Star Musical, yclept our Paddy REWSKI, gave
    his last "recital" at St. James's Hall, Thursday, November 27.
    Bedad, then, 'tis Misther Paddy REWSKI himself that is the
    broth of a boy entirely at the piano-forte, but, Begorra, he's
    better at the <i>piano</i> than the <i>forte.</i> He gave us a
    nice mixture of HANDEL, BEETHOVEN, CHOPIN, LISZT, and then a
    neat little compo of his own, consisting of a charming theme,
    with mighty ingenious and beautiful variations, all his own,
    divil a less. Great success for Paddy REWSKI. The Irish Pole,
    or Pole-ished Irishman, has thoroughly mastered his art, but if
    he has learnt how to master tune he has not yet perfected
    himself in <i>keeping strict time</i>, as he took his seat at
    the piano just one quarter of an hour late. Paddy REWSKI, me
    bhoy, when next you give us a recital, remember that
    punctuality is the soul of business. <i>Au revoir</i>, Paddy
    REWSKI!</p>

    <p>Yours entirely, JIM KRO MESKI.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>ADVICE GRATIS.&mdash;Go and see <i>London Assurance</i>,
    with "CHARLES our friend" in it, at the Criterion. It has,
    probably, never yet been put on the stage as it is <i>hic et
    nunc</i>. Well worth seeing as a <i>curio</i>. But what tin-pot
    nonsense is the Tally-ho speech of <i>Lady Grace Harkaway</i>.
    And yet it has always "gone," and <i>London Assurance</i>
    itself, like the sly Reynard of the speech, has invariably
    shown good sport, and given a good run for the money.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>MAD WAGGERY.&mdash;<i>The Chequers</i> is not the name of a
    wayside inn, but of one of those modern inventions calculated
    to help to fill Colney Hatch. A Puzzle it is, and it can be
    done&mdash;at least so say FELTHAM &amp; CO. Anyhow, they don't
    sell the solution, they only provide the mystery.</p>

        <p>"There is, however, another opinion prevalent among the
        less educated which gives to the Rattle-snake the
        vindictive spirit of the North American Indian, and asserts
        that it adds a new joint to its rattle whenever it has
        slain a human being, thus bearing in its tail the fearful
        trophies of its prowess, just as the Indians wear the
        scalps of slain foes."&mdash;<i>Wood's Natural

        DEFENDANT.

    <p>The Archbishop of CANTERBURY's learned judgment in the
    Lincoln Case was very much after the style in which His Grace
    parts his hair. It was a first-rate example of the <i>Via
    Media</i>.</p>

    <h2>A PAGE FROM A POSSIBLE DIARY.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Written in the Wild West.</i>)</h4>

    <p><i>Monday</i>.&mdash;Well, here I am. Guess I have got
    together a pretty tidy Army, that should beat BARNUM into small
    potatoes. The Arabs from Earl's Court will soon go along
    straight enough. They seem to miss the Louvre Theatre over
    yonder, where they were on the free list. Rather a pity I can't
    start a Show here, but I calculate the country is too
    disturbed.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;Nothing much doing. Sent along to
    SMALL BITE, and he has promised to come round along with a few
    of the Ghost-Dancers to let me see what I think of them. Fancy
    the <i>ballet</i> has been done before. That clever cuss GUS,
    must have used it at Covent Garden when he put up <i>Robert the
    Devil</i>. It seems like the Nun Ballet&mdash;uncommonly.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday</i>.&mdash;SMALL BITE is here. He's friendly
    enough, but his terms are too high. Fancy they must have been
    trying to annex him for the Aquarium. The Ghost-Dance is a
    fraud. Nothing in it. Might fake it up a bit with national
    flags and red fire. But it's decidedly disappointing.
    Altogether small pumpkins.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;Settlers want to know when I am going
    to begin. They are always in such a darned hurry. They ought to
    know I am the hero of a hundred fights (see my
    Autobiography&mdash;a few copies of which may still be had at
    the almost nominal price of half-a-dollar) and should rely on
    me accordingly. Am to visit the Indian Camp to-morrow.</p>

    <p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;Terms agreed. SMALL BITE and fifty
    braves engage themselves for six months certain, sharing terms,
    travelling exes, and one clear benefit. I find front of the
    curtain and advertising, they provide entertainment, which is
    to include Ghost-Dance (with banners and red fire) religious
    rites, war-dance, and scalping expedition with incidentals
    (SMALL BITE says he knows "some useful knockabout niggers") and
    procession in and out of towns. Think I can boom it.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday</i>.&mdash;My connection with war ended.
    Calculate I start to-morrow with the Show across the
    herring-pond, to wake up the Crowned Heads of Europe!</p>

    the other at the Gaiety. <i>Place au</i> "Divine WILLIAMS"!
    <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> is magnificently put on the stage.
    The costumes are probably O.K.&mdash;"all correct"&mdash;seeing
    that Mr. LEWIS WINGFIELD pledges his honourable name for the
    fact. We might have done with a few less, perhaps, but, as in
    the celebrated case of the war-song of the Jingoes, if we've
    got the men, and the money too, then there was every reason why
    the redoubtable LEWIS (whose name, as brotherly Masons will
    call to mind, means "Strength") should have put a whole army of
    Romans on the stage, if it so pleased him.</p>

             alt="" /></a>The Last Scene of Antony and Cleopatra.
    </div>

    <p>For its <i>mise-en-scène</i> alone the revival should
    attract all London. But there is more than this&mdash;there is
    the clever and careful impersonation of <i>Enobarbus</i> by His
    Gracious Heaviness, Mr. ARTHUR STIRLING; then there is a
    lighter-comedy touch in the courteous and gentlemanly rendering
    of <i>Octavius Cæsar</i> by Mr. F. KEMBLE COOPER&mdash;one of
    the best things in the piece, but from the inheritor of two
    such good old theatrical names, much is expected. And then
    there is the <i>Mark Antony</i> of Mr. CHARLES COGHLAN, a
    rantin', roarin' boy, this <i>Antony</i>, whom no one, I
    believe, could ever have made really effective; and finally.
    Her Graceful Majesty, Mrs. LANGTRY, Queen of Egyptian Witchery.
    Now honestly I do not consider <i>Cleopatra</i> a good part,
    nor is the play a good play for the matter of that. I believe
    it never has been a success, but if, apart from the really
    great attraction of gorgeous spectacular effects, there is any
    one scene above another which might well draw all London, it is
    the death of <i>Cleopatra</i>, which to my mind is&mdash;after
    the fall of WOLSEY, and a long way after, too,&mdash;one of the
    most pathetic pictures ever presented on the stage. So lonely
    in her grandeur, so grand, and yet so pitiable in her
    loneliness is this poor Queen of Beauty, this
    Empress-Butterfly, who can conquer conquerors, and for whose
    sake not only her noble lovers, but her poor humble
    serving-maids, are willing to die.</p>

             alt="" /></a>The Run of Cleopatra.
    </div>

    <p>Her last scene is beyond all compare her best, and to those
    who are inclined to be disappointed with the play after the
    first Act is over I say, "Wait for the end," and don't leave
    until the Curtain has descended on that gracious figure of the
    Queen of Egypt, attired in her regal robes, crowned with her
    diadem, holding her sceptre, but dead in her chair of state.
    <i>Ça donne à penser</i>.</p>

    <p><i>The Gaiety</i>.&mdash;In calling their burlesque
    <i>Carmen up to Data</i>, possibly the two dear clever boys who
    wrote it intended some crypto-jocosity of which the hidden
    meaning is known only to the initiated in these sublime
    mysteries. Why "<i>Data</i>"? On the other hand, "Why not?"</p>

    <p>However attractive or not as a heading in a bill of the
    play, the Gaiety <i>Carmen</i> is, on the whole, a merry,
    bright, and light burlesque-ish piece, though, except in the
    costume and make-up of Mr. ARTHUR WILLIAMS as <i>Captain
    Zuniga</i>, there is nothing extraordinarily "burlesque" in the
    appearance of any of the characters, as the appearance of Mr.
    HORACE MILLS as <i>Remendado</i> belongs more to Christmas
    pantomime than to the sly suggestiveness of real burlesque.</p>

    <p>As Miss ST. JOHN simply looks, acts, and sings as a genuine
    <i>Carmen</i>, I can only suppose that her voice is not strong
    enough for the real Opera; otherwise I doubt whether any better
    operatic impersonator of the real character could be found. She
    is not the least bit burlesque, and though the songs she has to
    sing are nothing like so telling as those she has had given her
    in former pieces, yet, through her rendering, most are encored,
    and all thoroughly appreciated.</p>

    <div class="figright"

             alt="" /></a>In for a good Run on the "Bogie" System.
    </div>

    <p>Mr. ARTHUR WILLIAMS as <i>Zuniga</i> is very droll,
    reminding some of us, by his make-up and jerky style, of MILHER
    as the comic <i>Valentine</i> in <i>Le Petit Faust</i>. Mr.
    LONNEN is also uncommonly good as the spoony soldier, and in
    the telling song of "<i>The Bogie Man</i>;" and in the still
    more telling dance with which he finishes it and makes his
    exit, he makes <i>the</i> hit of the evening,&mdash;in fact the
    hit by which the piece will he remembered, and to which it owes
    the greater part of its success.</p>

    <p>In the authors' latest adaptation of the very ancient
    "business" of "the statues"&mdash;consisting of a verse, and
    then an attitude, I was disappointed, as I had been led to
    believe that here we should see what Mr. LONNEN could do in the
    Robsonian or burlesque-tragedy style. The brilliancy of the
    costumes, of the scenery, the grace of the four dancers, and
    the excellence of band and chorus, under the direction of that
    ancient mariner MEYER LUTZ, are such as are rarely met with
    elsewhere.</p>

    <p>Mr. GEORGE EDWARDES may now attend to the building of his
    new theatre, as <i>Carmen up to Data</i> will not give him any
    trouble for some time to come.</p>

    <p><i>The Rosebud Annual</i>, published by JAMES CLARK &amp;
    CO., is quite a bright posy for our very little ones.</p>

    <p>Turning from novels, it is a relief to come across so
    inviting a little volume as the <i>Pocket Atlas, and Gazetteer
    of Canada</i>, which will be found of the greatest possible
    value to eccentric Londoners who purpose visiting the Dominion
    during the coming Winter.</p>

    <p>"<i>Persicos odi</i>," but you won't agree with HORACE if
    you follow this "<i>puer apparatus</i>" of G. NORWAY, who, in
    <i>Hussein's Hostage</i>, gives us the exciting adventures of a
    Persian boy.</p>

    <p><i>'Twixt School and College</i>, by GORDON STABLES, has
    nothing to do with horsey experiences, as suggested by the
    author's name, but is the uneventful home-life of a poor Scotch
    laddie, who triumphs by dint of pluck.</p>

    <p><i>Nutbrown Roger and I</i>, by J.H. YOXALL, a romance of
    the highway, quite in the correct style of disguises and
    blunderbusses always so necessary for a tale of this kind.</p>

    <p><i>Disenchantment</i> is the&mdash;not
    altogether&mdash;enticing title of "an everyday story," by F.
    MABEL ROBINSON, author of <i>The Plan of Campaign</i>. It is
    rather a long tale to tell, for it takes 432 pages in the
    unravelling. It ends with a beautiful avowal that "the heart is
    no more unchanging than the mind, and that love's not immortal,
    but an illusion." As the utterer of this truism is a young
    married woman, it would seem that the foundation is laid for a
    sequel to <i>Disenchantment</i> that might be appropriately
    called <i>Divorce</i>.</p>

    <p><i>The Secret of the Old House</i>, by EVELYN EVERETT GREEN,
    who evidently can't keep a secret to himself, will be so no
    longer when the children have satisfied their curiosity by
    reading the book.</p>

    <p>My faithful "Co." declares that he has been recently hard at
    work novel-reading. He has been revelling in an atmosphere of
    romance. He has been moved almost to tears by <i>Lady
    Hazleton's Confession</i>, by Mrs. KENT SPENDER, which, he
    says, includes, amongst many moving passages, some glimpses of
    Parliamentary life. <i>Friend Olivia</i>, in one bulky volume,
    takes the reader back to the days of CROMWELL, when people said
    "hath," instead of "has," and "pray resolve me truly," instead
    of "don't sell me;" and "Mr. JOHN MILTON" played upon the
    organ. It has a fine old crusty Puritan flavour about it,
    which, however, does not prevent the hero and heroine, in the
    last page, reading a letter together, "with smiles, and little
    laughs, and sweet asides, and sweeter kisses." Altogether, a
    book to read when a library does <i>not</i> contain WALTER
    SCOTT, ALEXANDRE DUMAS <i>père</i>, G.P.R. JAMES, or HARRISON
    AINSWORTH. <i>Two Masters</i> deals with passages in the life
    of a young lady who is described as "a Boarding-school Miss" in
    Volume I., and "a young she-fiend" in Volume III. However, it
    is only right to say, that the last compliment is paid to her
    by a gentlemanly murderer, who takes poison and a cigarette,
    with a view to escaping a justly-deserved death on the gallows.
    From this it may be seen, that the novel is at times slightly
    sensational. Fearing that his Christmas might be saddened by
    this last ghastly incident, were not the impression created by
    it partially removed by less highly-seasoned fare, my faithful
    "Co." has also read <i>Mary Hamilton, a Tale for Girls, My
    Schoolfellows</i>, and <i>Bonnie Boy's Soap Bubble</i>. He
    considers the first admirably adapted to the comprehension of
    the readers to whom it is addressed, only the girls, he says,
    should be <i>very</i> young girls. <i>My Schoolfellows</i> he
    intends reading again when he has reached his second childhood,
    when he fancies he will be better pleased with the humours of
    "<i>Guzzling Gus</i>" and "<i>Ned Never Mind</i>." In
    conclusion, he admits that he is a little doubtful about the
    merits or demerits of <i>Bonnie Boy's Soap Bubble</i>. He
    explains, that while he was reading it he "fell a thinking,"
    and that when he woke up, the volume was lying on the floor.
    Since then, he adds, he really has not had the leisure to pick
    it up.</p>

    <p><i>The Snake's Pass</i>, by BRAM STOKER, M.A. (SAMPSON LOW),
    is a simple love-story, a pure idyl of Ireland, which does not
    seem, after all, to be so distressful a country to live in.
    Whiskey punch flows like milk through the land; the loveliest
    girls abound, and seem instinctively to be drawn towards the
    right man. Also there are jooled crowns to be found by earnest
    seekers, with at least one large packing-case crammed with rare
    coins. The love-scenes are frequent and tempting. BRAM has an
    eye to scenery, and can describe it. He knows the Irish
    peasant, and reproduces his talk with a fidelity which almost
    suggests that he, too, is descended from one of the early
    kings, whereas, as everyone knows, he lives in London and adds
    grace and dignity to "the front" of the Lyceum on First Nights
    and others. He is perfectly overwhelming in his erudition in
    respect of the science of drainage, which, if all stories be
    true, he might find opportunity of turning to account in the
    every-day (or, rather, every-night) world of the theatre. In
    his novel he utilises it in the preliminaries of shifting a
    mighty bog, the last stages whereof are described in a chapter
    that, for sustained interest, recalls CHARLES READE's account
    of the breaking of the Sheffield Reservoir. The novel-reader
    will do well not to pass by <i>The Snake's Pass</i>. THE BARON

    <p><i>Opinion No. 1.</i>&mdash;Monte Carlo! One of the most
    disgraceful places in Europe&mdash;a blot upon our
    civilisation. The gambling is productive of the greatest
    possible misery. It is an institution that should be held up to
    the execration of mankind. All the riffraff of the globe are
    attracted to this hideous spot. The place is like an upas-tree,
    under which everything noble and good languishes and dies! The
    form of Government is absolutely immoral. It is a scandal that
    rates, and taxes, and public improvements should be paid for
    out of the private purse of the Director. He could not afford
    it had he not made a fortune out of his ill-gotten gains!
    Anyone who has watched at the tables knows that the chances are
    absolutely unfair&mdash;that the Direction must win. Not that
    this matters much. It is the general immorality of the place
    that is so alarming. The place should be closed at once; and
    persons who have lost anything, say, during the last year,
    should have their money promptly returned to them. And I say
    this without any bias, although I <i>did</i> back Red, and
    Black came up ten times running!</p>

    <p>P.S.&mdash;Just won a trifle. Not so sure that my pessimist
    view may not be modified.</p>

    <p><i>Opinion No. 2.</i>&mdash;Monte Carlo! Without exception,
    the loveliest spot in Europe. The so-called gambling is the
    cause of numberless blessings. It is an institution that should
    be held up to the admiration of mankind. All the aristocracy of
    the civilised world flock to it to indulge in a recreation to
    which only the greatly prejudiced can possibly take exception.
    The Government is benevolent to the last degree. In what other
    country are rates, taxes, and improvements paid for you? If the
    Director were not the best of men, how could this be done? The
    play itself is absolutely fair. And, with a system, and a
    sufficiency of capital, anyone is able to realise a large
    fortune in less than no time. Not that this absolute certainty
    should be taken into consideration. It is the general morality
    of the place that is so encouraging. The place should never
    close. And it would be a graceful thing if those who have laid
    in a store for their old age were to return a trifle, to be
    expended on some charity. And I say this without any bias,
    although I have backed Black ten times successfully.</p>

    <p>FROM A THEATRICAL CORRESPONDENT.&mdash;Sir,&mdash;I know a
    lot about London and N.B., but never till now did I know of the
    existence of 'ARRY in Scotland. The character is now
    represented, as I am informed, on the stage, by Mr. BEERBOHM
    TREE, who, in a play called <i>Back</i>, impersonates the MAC
    ARRY. Odd, this! for the McCOCKNIE. P.S.&mdash;One lives and
    learns. [*** If McCOCKNIE is to learn much, he will have to
    become a McMETHUSELAH. The piece to which he alludes is
    <i>Called Back</i>, by HUGH CONWAY and COMYNS CARR, and the
    part in it, excellently played by Mr. TREE, is <i>Macari</i>,
    an Italian.]</p>

    <h2>PARS ABOUT PICTURES.</h2>

    <p>"The Royal Society of Painters in Water-Colours?" said young
    PAR. "Nonsense! why all the water is frozen now, and so they
    can't paint!" "Precisely," replied I; "and that's why it is a
    nice exhibition!" This so startled Young PAR that he slipped
    and fell. I turned into the Gallery in Pall Mall, and left him
    sitting on the cold hard flags outside. Inside pleasant enough.
    BIRKET FOSTER's "<i>Island of Rum</i>" very
    comforting&mdash;should like some hot. HERBERT
    MARSHALL&mdash;our own City MARSHALL&mdash;has gone further
    afield, to "<i>Old Chelsea</i>." Should now be called the Field
    MAR SHALL. MATTHEW HALE, in "<i>Gathering Blackberries</i>," is
    a hail fellow well met! "<i>The Corso, Verona</i>," by S.J.
    HODSON, shows that HODSON's choice is a good one. HENRY MOORE's
    sea-pieces&mdash;the more the merrier, say I.
    "<i>Warkworth&mdash;Sunlit Shower</i>," by A.W. HUNT: a walk
    worth taking when the hunt is up. "<i>Holidays Past and
    Future</i>," suggests wide subjects and open spaces. Why, then,
    is it painted by SMALLFIELD? "<i>Wreck of the Halswell</i>," is
    a terrible catastrophe. Can't be "All's Well." Possibly the
    painter, G.H. ANDREWS, means "all swell"&mdash;that seems a
    great deal more likely. ALBERT GOODWIN shows himself to be a
    good winner in the "<i>Ponte Vecchio, Florence</i>." DU MAURIER
    delights us with some clever Society sketches in pen and
    pencil. The veteran, Sir JOHN GILBERT, is as young, as dashing,
    as vigorous as ever. H.G. GLINDONI has two pictures full of
    humour and character. STACY MARKS' "<i>Cockatoo</i>" looks as
    if it had just flown in from the Zoo. "<i>Au Sgarnach</i>," by
    C.B. PHILLIP. Title difficult to understand. Landscape easy to
    comprehend. A close study of Nature, admirably painted. A
    wholesome Phillippic against namby-pamby prettiness. "<i>On the
    Thames</i>," by G.A. FRIPP, honestly painted, and no frippery
    about it. Miss CLARA MONTALBA has a large number of pictures of
    Venice&mdash;and Mr. RIDGE comes up and says he is the Keeper.
    What Keeper? He whispers, he is the Keeper of the Cold
    Out&mdash;What an oridginal remark!&mdash;and will I step into

    <h2>ROBERT AT THE HOPERA.</h2>

    <p>I was habel the other day to do BROWN a good turn by getting
    him engaged at won of our big Otels, so he kindly offerd to
    stand a supper, and then take me to the Hopera at Common
    Garden. We went to see <i>Horfay</i>.</p>

    <p>It seems that wunce upon a time, ever so many thowsand years
    ago, before there was not no Lord Mares, nor no Shirryffs, nor
    not ewen no Aldermen, a Gent of the name of <i>Horfay</i> lived
    in Grease. He was the werry grandest Fiddler of his time, a
    regler JOEY KIM. Well, he married a werry bewtiful wife, of the
    name of <i>Yourridisee</i>, and they was both werry appy, till
    one day, as she was a having a run in a field, a norrid serpent
    bit her in her heel; so she died. Well, while poor <i>Mr.
    Horfay</i> is a telling us all about his trubbel, in comes a
    werry bewtiful young lady with a pair of most bewtiful wings
    on, and she werry kindly gives him a new sort of magic Fiddle,
    called, as I was told, A Liar! to go to&mdash;go down to <i>you
    kno where</i>, to git his wife back! Off he goes, and the neks
    sean shows us the werry plaice, all filled with savidges, and
    demons, and snakes, and things; and presently, when <i>Mr.
    Horfay</i> is seen a cumming down, all the demons and savidges
    runs at him to stop him; but he holds up the Liar, and begins
    for to sing, and most bewtifully too, tho' I didn't kno the
    tune; they all makes way for him, and he gos bang into lots of
    big flames, and so I werry naterally thort as how it was all
    over. But not a bit of it, for in the werry next sean we sees
    him with his Liar in a most lovly garden, all full of most
    lovly flowers and trees, and numbers of bewtiful ladies, a
    dancing and enjoying theirselves like fun, until his Liar leads
    him rite up to his wife, and then he raps harf his scarf round
    her, and off they gos together, both on 'em dowtless a longing
    for a reel nupshal kiss, but poor <i>Mr. Horfay</i> not a
    daring for to look at her, becoz if he does before he gets her
    home, she will be ded again direckly! Was there hever such a
    tanterlising case ever known! When she sings to him to give her
    one loving look, he sings to her to say he mustn't, until at
    larst she sets down on a nice cumferel-looking sofy, as appens
    for to be in the werry middel of the street, and says, werry
    artfully, as she carn't go not one step farther, when in course
    he turns round, and rushes up to her to have one fond embrace,
    and, thank goodness, they has it, and then she falls back
    dead!</p>

    <p>Well, now, I knos as I'm ony a mere Hed Waiter, and,
    therefore, not xpected to have any werry fine feelings, like my
    betters has, but</p>

    <p>I do declare that, when I saw this sad, sad end to all that
    grand amount of reel true Love, the tears run down my cheeks
    like rain, and I was a getting up to go away, when presently in
    came the lovly angel again, whose name I was told was Love, and
    told him that such love as his could conker Death itself; and
    she brort the pore wife to life again, and all hended, as all
    things shood end, jovial, and cumferal, and happy. What a
    wunderful thing is Music! It didn't seem at all strange to me
    that not one single word was spoke all the heavening, but ewery
    word sung, and in a forren tung, too, that I didn't
    hunderstand, the bewtiful story kep my atention fixt the hole
    time, and I warked home in the poring rain, werry thankful, and
    jest a leetle prowd, that in one thing, at least, I was not
    xacly like BROWN, who slept carm and content thro the hole of
    the larst hact.</p>

    <h3>The Fate of Salvation Army Generals.</h3>

    <p>This is dreadful! Why should the Generals be executed? What
    have they done to deserve this cruel fate? And what is the use

    <p>SOMETHING IN A NAME.&mdash;What a happily appropriate name
    for the Chief Magistrate of so fashionable a watering-place as
    Brighton is Mr. SOPER! Whether he is soft SOPER, or Hard SOPER,
    or Scented SOPER, it matters not; it is only a pity that after
    his year of office, if the Brightonian Bathers can spare him,
    he should not be transferred to Windsor. Old Windsor
    SOPER&mdash;what a splendid title for the Mayor of the Royal
    town! No doubt he will show himself active and energetic during
    his Mayoralty, and that at Brighton henceforth a totally
    opposite meaning from the ordinary one will be given to the
    description of a speech as "a SOPER-ific." At east, it is 'oped
    so, for the sake of SOPER.</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h3>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h3>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Tuesday Night, November</i>
    25.&mdash;New Session opened to-day. Remarkable gathering of
    Members in the Lords to hear Queen's Speech read. Unusual
    excitement, though heroically restrained in presence of LORD
    CHANCELLOR, supported on Woolsack by four figures in red cloaks
    and cocked hats, borrowed for occasion from Madame Tussaud's.
    HALSBURY lost his temper once when Commission being read.
    Tussaud's man, sent down to work the figures&mdash;make them
    take off their cocked hats and nod upon cue being given by
    Reading Clerk&mdash;was on duty for first time; much interested
    in arrival of Commons at the Bar; instead of lying low behind
    Woolsack and minding his business, kept poking his head round
    to peer forth on scene. At last, LORD CHANCELLOR in hoarse
    whisper threatened to send him to Clock Tower if he didn't
    behave properly.</p>

    <p>After this all went well; figures bringing their right elbow
    up with a jerk, took off their hats at precisely right moment,
    and replaced them without a hitch. They were labelled "Lord
    LATHOM," "Earl of COVENTRY," "Lord BROWNLOW," and "Lord
    KNUTSFORD." LORD CHANCELLOR sat in the middle. The ladies on
    floor of House watched them with much interest.</p>

    <p>"Such <i>dear</i> old things," said one, when the figure
    labelled "Earl of COVENTRY" cleverly pretended to sneeze. "I
    wish they'd do it all over again; but I suppose the springs
    have run down."</p>

    <p>In the Commons, everyone on the look out for PARNELL. What
    would he do? Where would he sit? What would he say? Or, would
    he come at all? Nobody knew. Some suspected last guess most
    probable. Towards Three o'Clock whisper went round that he was
    here. SARK had seen him crossing Lobby, with green spectacles
    and umbrella, and his hair died crimson. Was now in room with
    Irish Party, arranging about Leadership. Understood before
    House met that he was to retire from Leadership till fumes from
    Divorce Court had passed away. Then alliance between Home
    Rulers and Liberals would go on as before, and all would be
    well. Ministerialists downcast at this prospect; Liberals
    chirpy; a great difficulty avoided. Soon be in smooth water
    again.</p>

    <p>Waiting in House for business to commence. SPEAKER away for
    cause that saddens everyone; COURTNEY to take the Chair at Four
    o'Clock; meeting of Irish Members still going forward. When
    business concluded, PARNELL would quietly walk out; they would
    take their places, and things would go on as if no one had
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page276"
       id="page276"></a>[pg 276]</span> ever heard of Eltham, of
       alarums and excursions, of exits by fire-escapes, and
       entrances by back doors.</p>

    <p>Thinking of these things, I was standing by
    Sergeant-at-Arms' chair; heard a scuffling noise behind; looked
    round, and lo! there was PARNELL entering House by
    Distinguished Strangers' Gallery, descending by swarming down
    the end pillar, which supports Gallery from floor of House.</p>

    <p>"Good gracious!" I cried. "What are you doing?"</p>

    <p>"I'm catching the last post," said PARNELL, smiling blandly,
    as, reaching the floor, he unclasped arms and legs from the
    pillar and quietly walked over to his ordinary place as if this
    were the usual way of an Hon. Member approaching his seat.</p>

    <p>Direful news rapidly spread. PARNELL not going to retire
    from Leadership! On contrary, meant to stay, ignoring little
    events brought to light in the Divorce Court. Ministerialists
    jubilant; Liberals depressed; the whole situation changed;
    prospects of Liberal supremacy, so certain yesterday, suddenly
    blighted; talk of Mr. G. retiring from the fray; spoke on
    Address just now, but no fight left in him; the Opposition
    wrung out like a damp cloth; even GEORGE CAMPBELL dumb, and Dr.
    CLARK indefinitely postponed Amendment long threatened. By ten
    o'clock the whole thing had flickered out. Address, which of
    late has taken three weeks to pass, agreed to in three
    hours.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:30%;">
        <a href="images/276-1.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/276-1.png"
             alt="" /></a>Up a Tree.
    </div>

    <p>Mr. G. went off as soon as OLD MORALITY had finished his
    modest speech. Walked with him across the Park to Carlton
    Terrace. Haven't seen him to speak to since Midlothian. What a
    change! Then elate, confident, energetic, tingling with life to
    his finger-ends; to-night shrunken, limp, despondent, almost
    heart-broken.</p>

    <p>"Don't you think, Sir," I said, "that, after to-day's
    experience, Home Rule has a new terror? You remember how, seven
    or eight years ago, the Irish Members used to stand up in the
    House and personally vilify you. Then, when you came round to
    their side, the very same men beslabbered you with fulsome
    adulation. Now, when there is another parting of the ways, when
    you pit yourself, your authority, and your character, against
    their chosen Leader, they rudely turn their backs on you, and
    tell you to mind your own business. How'll it be, do you think,
    when you've finally served their purpose, and made possible the
    accomplishment of their aim? When you have made them Masters in
    Dublin, will they care any more for the views and prejudices of
    you and your Liberal Party than they have done to-day?"</p>

    <p>"TOBY, dear boy," said Mr. G., "you're a young dog yet. When
    you come to my age, you'll have learned that there is no
    gratitude in politics. But we won't talk of it any more. I'm a
    little tired to-night."</p>

    <p>So we walked in silence up the steps, by the Duke of YORK's
    Column.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Address agreed to. Mr. P. flouts
    Mr. G.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;House up at twenty minutes to Six,
    having got through rattling lot of business. Prince ARTHUR been
    sailing up and down floor, bringing in Land Bills and Railway
    Bills. HICKS-BEACH depressed with legacy of Tithes Bill.</p>

    <p>"Cheer up, BEACH," says CRANBORNE, tugging at his moustache
    à la GRANDOLPH; "you may depend upon me. Keep your eye on your
    young friend, and he will pull you through."</p>

    <p>"Thank you," said BEACH, with something more than his
    customary effusive manner.</p>

    <p>JACKSON toying round the table, packing and unpacking
    papers, looking at his watch and the clock, vaguely whistling,
    and absently rubbing his hands.</p>

    <p>"What's the matter?" I asked. "You seem out of sorts."</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:22%;">
        <a href="images/276-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/276-2.png"
             alt="" /></a>Mr. P-rn-ll turns his Back on Public
             Opinion.
    </div>

    <p>"Matter!" he cried. "Why, twenty minutes to Six is the
    matter, and here's all the work done and the House up. It's
    absolutely demoralising; portends something uncanny. On Tuesday
    we got through the Address in a single short sitting;
    yesterday, after meeting at noon, had to adjourn for three
    hours and a half; filled up remainder of time with bringing in
    Bills; To-day we have an Irish Land Bill brought in and read a
    First Time, after a Debate confined to SAGE OF QUEEN ANNE'S
    GATE, and WILFRID LAWSON. Nothing like it seen for sixteen
    years. If this kind of thing goes on, you know, we'll get all
    the work of the Session done in three months, and perhaps done
    better than when it took nine. It's the suddenness that knocks
    me over, TOBY. They ought to be more considerate, and begin
    more gently."</p>

    <p>Great commotion in Irish circles. Scene slightly shifted. It
    seems that Irish Members in re-electing PARNELL on Tuesday,
    thought he would relieve them of difficulty by forthwith
    resigning. Mr. P. doesn't take that view; thinks it would be
    rude, after having been unanimously elected, to appear to
    undervalue such remarkable, spontaneous act of confidence;
    doesn't care a rap for public opinion.</p>

    <p>"<i>J'y suis, et j'y reste</i>," he says, smiling sweetly
    round the table, where his friends forlornly sit.</p>

    <p>"Begorra!" says Mr. O'KEEF, indignantly, "it's bad enough to
    have him ruining us and the counthry, without using
    blasphaymious language."</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Everything on the paper.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:25%;">
        <a href="images/276-3.png"><img width="100%"

    </div>

    <p><i>Friday Night</i>.&mdash;Louis JENNINGS made capital
    speech to-night on Motion challenging commutation of certain
    perpetual pensions. Seems, among other little jobs, we, the
    tax-payers of Great Britain, with Income-tax at sixpence in the
    pound, have been paying pension of £2,000 a year to descendant
    of the late ELLEN GWYNNE. Select Committee appointed by present
    Government to consider whole matter, recommended that no
    pension should be commuted at rate so high as twenty-seven
    years' purchase. JOKIM, generous with other people's money,
    flies in face of recommendation, and comfortably rounds off one
    or two of these little jobs with gratuity of twenty-seven
    years' purchase. Cheerful to hear this sort of thing denounced
    in breezy fashion from Conservative Benches. JENNINGS, amid
    loud cheers, hits straight out from the shoulder. WALTER FOSTER
    quite delighted. "Bless you, my child," he says, "you ought to
    belong to the Radical Party." <i>Business

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
